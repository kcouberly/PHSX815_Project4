## spectral_distribution.py

Plots a histogram and prints maximum wavelength bin using Planck's law.

Currently set to 3000K (line 13) change this variable to simulate additional surface temperatures.

Creates a probability distribution for each nm wavelength calculated using Planck's law.

Simulates a dataset of 30000 samples over a wavelength range from 1 to 2000 nm.

Runs without inputs.
